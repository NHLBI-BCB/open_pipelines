pipelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
    This documentation is incomplete and inaccurate. We're working on it.

This repository contains some of the NGS pipelines developed in the Bock lab.

To get started, proceed with the :doc:`Getting started <getting_started>` or use the table of contents below to navigate the docs.

Sister projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Pypiper <http://pypiper.readthedocs.io/>`_ and `Looper <http://looper.readthedocs.io/>`_ work together as a comprehensive pipeline management system. `Pypiper <http://pypiper.readthedocs.io/>`_ builds individual, single-sample pipelines that can be run one sample at a time. `Looper <http://looper.readthedocs.io/>`_ then processes groups of samples, submitting appropriate pipelines to a cluster or server. The two projects are independent and can be used separately, but they are most powerful when combined.
