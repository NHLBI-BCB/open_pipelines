# tools:
  # in the tools section, you may provide the CpG-seq pipeline with the absolute path of the required bioinformatic tools
  # set to 'java' or 'picard', to use the tool from your $PATH variable

# the parameters section is intended for all parameters passed to bioinformatic tools
parameters:
  # which trimmer to use:
  # choose between ["trimmomatic", "skewer"]
  trimmer: "skewer"
  # maximum allowed fragment size allowed to align
  max_insert: 2000
  # read quality to keep
  read_quality: 30
  # peak caller to use
  # choose between ["macs2", "spp"]
  peak_caller: "macs2"
  # peak window width
  peak_window_width: 1000


# Factors considered as histones
# Factors matching this as substring
# will be considered as well (e.g. H3K4ME3)
histones:
  - "H2A"
  - "H2B"
  - "H3"
  - "H4"
