# The project config file, originally in .cfg format
# This file describes all *project-specific variables*
# Its primary purpose as as input to Looper, which will submit jobs as appropriate
# for each sample in the project.
# But it is also read by multiple other tools, including:
# - project sample loop (primary purpose)
# - make_trackhubs scripts to produce web accessible results
# - stats summary scripts
# - analysis scripts requiring pointers to metadata, results, and other options.

# Relative paths are considered relative to this project config file.

paths:
  # output_dir: the parent, shared space where results will go
  output_dir: projects/test
  # raw_data_path: the parent directory with raw data
  raw_data_path: projects/test/samples
  # sample_annotation: one-row-per-sample metadata
  sample_annotation: test.csv
  # merge_table: input for samples with more than one input file
  merge_table: test_merge.csv
  # compare_table: comparison pairs or groups, like normalization samples
  compare_table: table_compare.csv
  # pipelines_dir: the directory where the Looper will find pipeline
  # scripts (and accompanying pipeline config files) for submission.
  pipelines_dir: ../src_pipelines

data_sources:
  # specify the location of input files using variable path expressions
  # entries correspond to values in the data_source column in sample_annotation table
  # {variable} can be used to replace environment variables or other sample_annotation columns
  bsf_samples: "{RAWDATA}{flowcell}/{flowcell}_{lane}_samples/{flowcell}_{lane}#{BSF_name}.bam"
