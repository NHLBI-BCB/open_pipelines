# The protocol mappings explains how the looper should map from a sample protocol
# (like RNA-seq) to a particular pipeline (like rnaseq.py), or group of pipelines.
# You can map multiple pipelines to a single protocol if you want samples of a
# type to kick of more than one pipeline run
# The basic format for pipelines run simultaneously is:
# PROTOCOL: pipeline1 [, pipeline2, ...]
# Use semi-colons to indicate dependency (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
# Examples:
# Basic case: one protocol maps to one pipeline.
# RNA-seq: rnaseq.py
# Case: one protocol maps to multiple independent pipelines.
# Drop-seq: quality_control.py, dropseq.py
# Case: a protocol runs one pipeline which depends on another
# Quant-seq: first-step.py; second-step.py
# WGBSNM: first;second;third;(fourth, fifth)
